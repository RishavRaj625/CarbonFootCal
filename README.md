## Carbon Footprint Calculations

The application uses the following emission factors:

| Category | Emission Factor |
|----------|----------------|
| Electricity | 0.4 kg CO2/kWh |
| Natural Gas | 5.3 kg CO2/therm |
| Water | 0.0002 kg CO2/gallon |
| Car Travel | 8.887 kg CO2/gallon (assuming 25 MPG) |
| Public Transit | 0.17 kg CO2/mile |
| Short-haul Flights | 500 kg CO2/flight |
| Long-haul Flights | 1600 kg CO2/flight |
| Meat | 3.0 kg CO2/serving |
| Dairy | 0.7 kg CO2/serving |
| Plant-based | 0.2 kg CO2/serving |

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- **users**: User account information and profiles
- **carbon_footprint**: Daily carbon footprint entries
- **user_streaks**: Streak tracking and user statistics

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Visualization**: Plotly
- **Data Processing**: Pandas
